# Pharmacovigilance ADE Classifier

A paired-bootstrap ablation study of biomedical-domain pretraining on a binary
adverse-drug-event (ADE) sentence-classification task.

## What this is

This project fine-tunes three transformer encoders — `bert-base-uncased`,
BioBERT, and PubMedBERT — on the classification split of ADE Corpus v2 and
asks two narrow questions. First, does biomedical-domain pretraining
measurably improve downstream performance over a general-domain baseline?
Second, does from-scratch biomedical pretraining (PubMedBERT) improve over
continued pretraining from general-domain weights (BioBERT)? The study is
best read as a methodology demonstration of honest significance testing on a
small corpus, not as a general claim about pretraining recipes.

## Headline result

At argmax threshold 0.5, PubMedBERT beats base BERT on both macro-F1
(gap -0.012, 95% CI [-0.024, -0.003]) and PR-AUC (-0.018, CI [-0.031, -0.007]).
BioBERT improves probability ranking over base BERT (PR-AUC gap -0.012, CI
[-0.020, -0.005]) but its macro-F1 improvement is not distinguishable from
zero. Effect sizes are modest — roughly one percentage point macro-F1 — and
the evaluation is confined to one corpus and one test split. See
[`docs/paper.md`](docs/paper.md) for the full writeup and
[`results/pairwise_gaps.csv`](results/pairwise_gaps.csv) for the raw numbers.

## Quickstart

The fastest path to reproducing a result is to run the analysis notebook on
the committed run outputs. No GPU needed, takes about ten seconds end to end.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tysonjohnsondev/pharmacovigilance-ade-classifier.git
cd pharmacovigilance-ade-classifier
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate    # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements-colab.txt
pip install -e .
jupyter lab notebooks/analysis.ipynb
```

Requires Python 3.10+. Every figure and table in `paper.md` regenerates from
committed artifacts in `results/` without retraining. To retrain the 30-run
ablation (3 models x 10 seeds) on Colab, see
[`docs/reproduce.md`](docs/reproduce.md).
